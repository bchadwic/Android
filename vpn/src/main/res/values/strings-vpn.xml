    <string name="trackerProfilingActivityTitle">About App Trackers</string>
    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoTitle">What are app trackers?</string>
    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoFirstParagraph">Youâ€™ve probably heard about companies like Google and Facebook tracking you behind the scenes on third-party websites. But did you know they also track your personal information through apps on your device?\n\nIn 2021, DuckDuckGo found that <b>over 70% of 100 of the top apps on Android contain trackers from major companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.</b> Over 70% of those same apps send personal data to at least one of these companies, even when youâ€™re not using your device.\n\n<b>Trackers in apps may have access to a lot more information</b> than their website tracker cousins, such as your location down to which floor of a building you\'re on, how often you play games while at work, and when and how long you sleep each day. <b>Even if you havenâ€™t given apps explicit permission to collect data, they can still take it without your knowledge.</b>\n\nTracking networks like Facebook and Google use these little pieces of information <b>to build a digital profile about you.</b> With it, tracking networks can manipulate what you see online and allow advertisers to bid on access to you based on your data.\n\nTrackers in apps is a BIG problem for privacy. <b>But DuckDuckGo has a solution that can help.</b>\n\nWhen enabled in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser app, Device Shield blocks many trackers in other apps, not just the trackers we find on websites when you browse. <b>These dual layers of protection reduce what companies know about you overall</b>, so you can use your apps with more peace of mind, knowing youâ€™re more protected.</string>

    <!--  Device Shield FAQ -->
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQActivityTitle">Device Shield FAQ</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFirstHeader">What trackers does Device Shield block?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFirstText">Device Shield <b>blocks known trackers</b> that it identifies <b>from third-party companies, or those different from the company that owns each app.</b> For example, if Facebook owns the app, Device Shield doesnâ€™t block its trackers, but would block trackers from Google or Amazon. Weâ€™re always on the lookout for other trackers for Device Shield to block.\n\nSome apps and known trackers might be excluded automatically based on whether theyâ€™d work properly with Device Shield enabled. </string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQSecondHeader">Why does Device Shield use a VPN connection?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQSecondText">Youâ€™ll be asked to set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection, <b>but you don\'t need to install a VPN app for Device Shield to work.</b>\n\nThis permission, which works only on your device, allows Device Shield to monitor network traffic <b>so that it can block known trackers.</b></string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQThirdHeader">How is Device Shield different from a VPN?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQThirdText">A traditional VPN sends your data from the device to its own server, where it secures and anonymizes your data from prying eyes. <b>However, this allows the VPN company to see your network traffic.</b>\n\n<b>Device Shield is different.</b> Instead of sending your data to a VPN server, <b>Device Shield works only on your device</b>, sitting between your apps and the servers they talk to.\n\nWhenever Device Shield recognizes a known tracker, <b>it blocks the tracker from sending personal information (such as your IP address, activity, and device details) off your device.</b> All other traffic reaches its destination, so your apps work normally.</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFourthHeader">Is my data private?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFourthText">Device Shield works only on your device and doesnâ€™t send your data off your device to DuckDuckGo. <b>We donâ€™t collect or store any data from your apps.</b></string>
