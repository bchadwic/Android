    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoTitle">What are app trackers?</string>
    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoFirstParagraph">You’ve probably heard about companies like Google and Facebook tracking you behind the scenes on third-party websites. But did you know they also track your personal information through apps on your device?\n\nIn 2021, DuckDuckGo found that <b>over 70% of 100 of the top apps on Android contain trackers from major companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon.</b> Over 70% of those same apps send personal data to at least one of these companies, even when you’re not using your device.\n\n<b>Trackers in apps may have access to a lot more information</b> than their website tracker cousins, such as your location down to which floor of a building you\'re on, how often you play games while at work, and when and how long you sleep each day. <b>Even if you haven’t given apps explicit permission to collect data, they can still take it without your knowledge.</b>\n\nTracking networks like Facebook and Google use these little pieces of information <b>to build a digital profile about you.</b> With it, tracking networks can manipulate what you see online and allow advertisers to bid on access to you based on your data.\n\nTrackers in apps is a BIG problem for privacy. <b>But DuckDuckGo has a solution that can help.</b>\n\nWhen enabled in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser app, Device Shield blocks many trackers in other apps, not just the trackers we find on websites when you browse. <b>These dual layers of protection reduce what companies know about you overall</b>, so you can use your apps with more peace of mind, knowing you’re more protected.</string>

    <!--  Device Shield FAQ -->

    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFirstHeader">What trackers does Device Shield block?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFirstText">Device Shield <b>blocks known trackers</b> that it identifies <b>from third-party companies, or those different from the company that owns each app.</b> For example, if Facebook owns the app, Device Shield doesn’t block its trackers, but would block trackers from Google or Amazon. We’re always on the lookout for other trackers for Device Shield to block.\n\nSome apps and known trackers might be excluded automatically based on whether they’d work properly with Device Shield enabled.</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQSecondHeader">Why does Device Shield use a VPN connection?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQSecondText">You’ll be asked to set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection, <b>but you don\'t need to install a VPN app for Device Shield to work.</b>\n\nThis permission, which works only on your device, allows Device Shield to monitor network traffic <b>so that it can block known trackers.</b></string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQThirdHeader">How is Device Shield different from a VPN?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQThirdText">A VPN sends your data from the device to its own server, where it secures and anonymizes your data from prying eyes. However, this allows the VPN company to see your network traffic.\n\n<b>Device Shield is different.</b> Instead of sending your data to a VPN server, <b>Device Shield works only on your device</b>, sitting between your apps and the servers they talk to.\n\nWhenever Device Shield recognizes a known tracker, <b>it blocks the tracker from sending personal information (such as your IP address, activity, and device details) off your device.</b> All other traffic reaches its destination, so your apps work normally.</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFourthHeader">Is my data private?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFourthText">Device Shield works only on your device and doesn’t send your data off your device to DuckDuckGo. <b>We don’t collect or store any data from your apps.</b></string>
